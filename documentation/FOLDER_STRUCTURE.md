# Folder Structure

The high-level folder structure looks as follows:

```
/
├── documentation/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── js/
│   └── scss/
├── ...(config files)
└── README.md
```

#### `public/`

All gulp compilated projects assets go here: css and js. Do not make any adjustments here, as these will be overwritten anyway.

#### `src/`

The asset source codes. The right place to do your work.
